# Cathode-ray Tube Multi-Stage Filter
This is a demonstration of a multi-stage shader, where we process one render result with a new shader multiple times. It is not the best shader code; an improved single-stage version is available in `demo/crt-singlestage`. This is primarily left here to provide an example on how to create multi-stage shaders.
